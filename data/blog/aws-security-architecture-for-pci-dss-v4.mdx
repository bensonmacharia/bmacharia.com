[PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/pci-dss) is a global security standard designed to protect credit and debit card data. It applies to any organization that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder information. PCI DSS is important because payment card data is a major target for cybercriminals, and a single breach can lead to financial loss, legal penalties, and loss of customer trust. By following PCI DSS requirements, organizations reduce the risk of data breaches and show customers and partners that their payment data is handled securely.

[PCI DSS version 4](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0_1.pdf) introduces more stringent and modern security requirements to address today’s evolving threats and cloud-based environments. It places stronger emphasis on **continuous security, risk-based controls, and accountability** rather than simple checkbox compliance. The main requirements for PCI DSS v4 include:

| Requirement                                                                              | New or Updated in v4?                                                     |

AWS Cloud helps organizations achieve PCI DSS v4 compliance faster and more efficiently compared to traditional on-premises data centers. AWS provides a secure-by-design infrastructure with built-in controls for network security, encryption, identity management, logging, and monitoring, which directly support many PCI DSS requirements.

### PCI DSS v4 Compliance on AWS

By using managed AWS services, organizations reduce operational overhead, improve consistency, and more easily meet the continuous security expectations introduced in PCI DSS v4. The sections below provide a detailed guide on how different AWS services can assist organizations in achieving PCI DSS v4 compliance.

#### Requirement 1: Install and maintain network security controls

AWS enables strong network security using services such as [Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/), [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html), and [network ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html) to control inbound and outbound traffic. Customers can design isolated cardholder data environments (CDEs) using VPC segmentation, private subnets, and [AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/). These controls are software-defined, easier to audit, and quicker to change than traditional physical firewalls.

#### Requirement 2: Apply secure configurations to all system components

AWS helps enforce secure system configurations using services like [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/), [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/), and [Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html). Organizations can define baseline configurations, continuously monitor drift, and automatically remediate non-compliant resources. This supports PCI DSS v4’s emphasis on configuration management and continuous compliance.

#### Requirement 3: Protect stored account data

AWS provides strong encryption capabilities through [AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html) and [AWS CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/). Cardholder data can be encrypted at rest across services such as [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), and [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html). AWS also supports key rotation, access controls, and separation of duties, which are critical for PCI DSS v4 key management requirements.

#### Requirement 4: Protect cardholder data during transmission

AWS supports encryption in transit using TLS across its services. Load balancers such as [Application Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/) and [Network Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/network-load-balancer/) integrate with [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) to manage certificates securely. This allows organizations to enforce strong cryptography without managing certificates manually.

#### Requirement 5: Protect all systems and networks from malicious software

AWS helps protect against malware and phishing threats using [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/), [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/), and [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/). These services provide threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and continuous monitoring, aligning with PCI DSS v4’s expanded focus on evolving attack techniques.

#### Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and software

AWS supports secure development through services such as [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/), [CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/), and [CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/), combined with security scanning tools like Amazon Inspector. Infrastructure as Code using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) allows secure, repeatable deployments and controlled change management.

#### Requirement 7: Restrict access to system components and cardholder data

[AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) allows fine-grained, role-based access control using least privilege principles. Access to the cardholder data environment can be tightly controlled and audited, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

#### Requirement 8: Identify users and authenticate access to system components

PCI DSS v4 significantly expands [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html) requirements, which AWS supports natively through IAM and AWS Single Sign-On. MFA can be enforced for all privileged and remote access to systems that handle cardholder data.

#### Requirement 9: Restrict physical access to cardholder data

Under the [AWS shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/), AWS manages physical security of data centers, including access controls, surveillance, and environmental protections. This removes a major compliance burden compared to on-premises data centers.

#### Requirement 10: Log and monitor all access to system components and cardholder data

AWS provides centralized logging and monitoring using [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/), [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), and [AWS OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/). These services enable detailed audit trails, real-time alerts, and log retention, supporting PCI DSS v4’s stronger monitoring and detection requirements.

#### Requirement 11: Test security of systems and networks regularly

AWS supports continuous testing through Amazon Inspector, automated vulnerability scanning, and integration with third-party penetration testing tools. PCI DSS v4’s requirement for targeted risk analysis is easier to achieve with automated and scalable cloud-based testing.

#### Requirement 12: Support information security with organizational policies and programs

AWS provides compliance reports, audit artifacts, and security best practices through [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/). Combined with services like [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) and [Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/), organizations can define responsibilities, perform risk assessments, and maintain ongoing security governance as required by PCI DSS v4.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, designing a PCI DSS v4 compliant environment on AWS allows organizations to meet strict security requirements while gaining the flexibility and scalability of the cloud. AWS provides a wide range of managed services that support encryption, access control, monitoring, and continuous security, which are core to PCI DSS v4. By leveraging the AWS shared responsibility model and security best practices, organizations can reduce complexity, lower operational costs, and maintain compliance more effectively than in traditional on-premises environments. This approach not only helps achieve compliance faster but also supports ongoing security improvements as threats and business needs evolve.
