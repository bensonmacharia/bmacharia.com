This article is a continuation of the [previous post](https://bmacharia.com/blog/devsecops-pipeline-sast), where we introduced Semgrep in the DevSecOps pipeline to perform Static Application Security Testing (SAST).

In this article, we focus on integrating [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) into the same DevSecOps pipeline to perform Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).

## Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is the process of identifying and analyzing third-party and open-source components used in an application to detect known security vulnerabilities, license risks, and outdated dependencies. Modern applications rely heavily on open-source libraries, which can introduce hidden risks if not properly managed.

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) complements SCA by providing a structured inventory of all components, libraries, and dependencies included in an application, along with their versions and relationships.

## Next steps

This is the end of Part 3. In the upcoming Part 4 we will add more stages into our pipeline including
